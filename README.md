# About Project Noise Meter

> Are you curious about the health impact of the environmental noise in Toronto?

> Is the environmental noise in Toronto a public health concern?


To answer these questions, we started Project Noise Meter. The project is building low cost IoT devices for citizens to measure in real-time the ambient environmental noise in their neigbourhoods. A data store and a monitoring dashboard are being developed to collect and visualize the noise data. The project is under active development by a group of Civic Tech Toronto volunteers.
